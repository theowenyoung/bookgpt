1. "And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away. And that companion fact: when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need." 

> "那些必须在社会动荡中失去土地的大地主们，他们有着历史的见识，有着读懂历史的眼睛，知道一个大事实：当财产集中在少数人手中时，它必然会被夺走。还有一个相伴的事实：当大多数人都饥寒交迫时，他们会动用武力争取他们所需的东西。"

2. "Man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments."

> "你怎么能吓唬一个人呢，他的饥饿不仅在他自己狭窄的胃里，还在他孩子可怜的肚子里？你不能吓唬他——他已经经历了比其他一切更大的恐惧。"

9. "I figgered, 'Why do we got to hang it on God or Jesus? Maybe,' I figgered, 'maybe it's all men an' all women we love; maybe that's the Holy Sperit—the human sperit—the whole shebang. Maybe all men got one big soul ever'body's a part of.' Now I sat there thinkin' it, an' all of a suddent—I knew it. I knew it so deep down that it was true, and I still know it."

An' the people that listen to him—full of it too like me—only they don't know it. They can't see it. An' I'm gonna bust this here game wide open." 

> "我从来不知道是这样的。我从来不知道。你们都是死人。你们全都是。你们都是虚伪的。他们无耻地撒谎。像那个传教士一样。还有那些听他讲道的人——像我一样也充满了虚伪——只是他们不知道。他们看不到。我要打破这个游戏。"

13. "The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price, and this is the saddest, bitterest thing of all. Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit—and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains." 

> "为了维持价格，葡萄树、树木的根必须被毁掉，这是最悲哀、最痛苦的事情。车载车载的橙子倒在地上。人们走了几英里来取果子，但这是不可能的。如果他们可以开车去摘，他们怎么会以一打二十美分的价格买橙子呢？然后有人用软管喷洒煤油在橙子上，他们对这种犯罪感到愤怒，对那些来取果子的人也感到愤怒。有一百万个饥饿的人需要这些果子，而煤油却喷洒在了金色的山上。"

14. "A fella ain't got a soul of his own, just little piece of a big soul, the one big soul that belongs to everybody." 

> "一个人没有自己的灵魂，只有一个大灵魂的一小部分，这个大灵魂属于每一个人。"

15. "Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold. And all of them were caught in something larger than themselves." 

> "一些业主是仁慈的，因为他们讨厌自己必须做的事情，一些业主是愤怒的，因为他们讨厌残忍，一些业主是冷漠的，因为他们早已发现，除非冷漠，否则不能成为业主。他们所有人都被困在比自己更大的事情中。"

## 请用通俗的语言介绍这本书的重点内容

**The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck**

The Grapes of Wrath is a classic novel written by John Steinbeck and published in 1939. The story is set during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, and follows the Joad family, a poor family of tenant farmers from Oklahoma who are forced to migrate westward to California in search of work and a better life.

The novel is a powerful and poignant portrayal of the struggles of the working poor during this time period. Steinbeck masterfully weaves together themes of poverty, injustice, prejudice, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

The Joad family, like many others, are driven from their homes by the economic and environmental devastation of the Dust Bowl. They pack their belongings into a dilapidated truck and set out for the promised land of California, where they believe they will find work and a better life.

Along the way, they experience a series of hardships and setbacks, including the death of family members, illness, and exploitation by unscrupulous employers. They encounter other migrants who are also struggling, and form a bond of solidarity with them, sharing what little they have and helping each other survive.

Ultimately, the Joads arrive in California only to find that their dreams of a better life are shattered. They are met with hostility and violence from locals who view them as unwanted outsiders, and are forced to take menial jobs for low pay and poor conditions.

Despite their hardships, the Joad family and the other migrants refuse to give up hope. They organize and protest against the injustices they face, and strive to create a better future for themselves and their children.

The Grapes of Wrath is a masterpiece of American literature that captures the struggles and triumphs of the working poor during one of the darkest periods in American history. It is a timeless story that continues to resonate with readers today, reminding us of the importance of compassion, solidarity, and the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity.

**《愤怒的葡萄》**

《愤怒的葡萄》是由约翰·斯坦贝克写的一部经典小说，于1939年出版。故事发生在20世纪30年代的大萧条和尘土飞扬时期，讲述了乔德家族，一个来自俄克拉荷马州的贫困佃农家庭，被迫向西迁徙，以寻找工作和更好的生活。

这部小说巧妙地编织了贫困、不公、偏见和人类精神在逆境中的坚韧主题。斯坦贝克巧妙地将这些主题融合在一起，创造出一个令人难忘的故事。

乔德一家像许多其他家庭一样，被尘土飞扬的经济和环境破坏迫使离开家园。他们把自己的财物装进一辆破旧的卡车，前往加利福尼亚的理想国家，他们相信那里会找到工作和更好的生活。

在路上，他们经历了一系列的困难和挫折，包括家庭成员的死亡、疾病和不良老板的剥削。他们遇到了其他的移民，他们也在挣扎，他们建立起一个团结的纽带，共享他们所拥有的，并互相帮助生存下来。

最终，乔德一家到达加利福尼亚，却发现他们的美梦破灭了。他们遭到当地人的敌意和暴力，被视为不受欢迎的局外人，并被迫接受低工资和恶劣条件的卑微工作。

尽管遭受了许多困难，乔德一家和其他移民拒绝放弃希望。他们组织抗议不公，努力为自己和孩子创造更美好的未来。

《愤怒的葡萄》是美国文学的杰作，捕捉了美国历史上最黑暗时期工薪阶层的斗争和胜利。它是一个永恒的故事，今天仍然与读者产生共鸣，提醒我们同情、团结和人类精神在克服逆境中的重要性。
