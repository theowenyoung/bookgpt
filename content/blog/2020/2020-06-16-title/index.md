## 请列出 15 条这本书值得高亮的段落

4. "But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs."  
然而，她对周围人的影响是无法计算的扩散：因为世界的日益进步在一定程度上取决于不被历史所记载的行动；而我们不像可能已经破产的人们那样生活得那么艰难，这在很大程度上归功于那些默默无闻地过着隐秘生活、躺在无人祭拜的坟墓里的人们。

5. "It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view."  
不能从各个角度看待一个问题的人，是一个心胸狭隘的人。

6. "We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, 'Oh, nothing!' Pride helps; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our hurts— not to hurt others."

坦诚而公正；真诚而谨慎——这是一个持续的难题。

9. "It is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted."  
即使我们所谓的高度受过教育，却无法享受，这本身就是一种不安。在这个伟大的人生观中存在，却永远无法从小小的饥饿、颤抖的自我中解放出来——永远无法完全拥有我们所看到的荣耀，永远无法将我们的意识狂热地转化为思想的生动性、激情的热情、行动的能量，而总是学者而不受启发，雄心勃勃而胆怯，一丝不苟而目光短浅。

10. "I'm not afraid of being thought unimportant, I'm not afraid of being laughed at."  
我不怕被认为是无关紧要的，我不怕被嘲笑。

11. "The strongest principle of growth lies in human choice."  
成长的最强原则在于人类的选择。

12. "We all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act fatally on the strength of them."  
我们所有人，无论严肃或轻松，都会被隐喻所缠绕，而且在它们的力量下，我们的行为是致命的。

要完全快乐是一件困难的事情，但善良却是非常容易的，这是最大的幸福衡量标准。

14. "It is a common sentence that knowledge is power; but who hath duly considered or set forth the power of ignorance? Knowledge slowly builds up what ignorance in an hour pulls down."  
知识就是力量，这是一个常见的话语；但有谁曾经充分考虑或阐述无知的力量？知识缓慢地构建，而无知在一小时内拆除。

15. "We are all humiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very comfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we have been making up our world entirely without it."  
当我们突然发现一个已经存在了很长时间、可能一直在私下里盯着我们的事实时，我们都会感到羞辱，因为我们在完全没有这个事实的情况下建立了我们的世界。
